Skriv dit eksamensnummer i sidehovedet.

SÃ¸rg for at lave sikkerhedsbackup undervejs. Dette er dit eget ansvar og
din sikkerhed ved nedbrud.


\bigskip

Write your exam number in the header.

Make sure you take security copies of your paper while the exam is in
progress. It is your own responsibility in case of technical error.

|-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+

\end{lstlisting}
\begin{align}
TUM(A) \wedge b \in \mathbb{Z} \implies x^* \in \mathbb{Z}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
\label{ob} \max \; \quad & \sum_{j=1}^nc_jx_j  \\
\label{c1} \mbox{s.t.} \quad &\sum\limits_{j=1}^n a_{ij}x_j\geq b_i,
\quad i=1,\ldots,m \\
\label{c2}   &x_j \geq 0, \quad j=1,\ldots,n   
\end{align}


\begin{align}
\begin{bmatrix}
5 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & -10 & 0 & 5\\
3 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 2 & 0 & 5\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 2\\
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 3 & 0 & 5\\
2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 1 & -2\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
We need to take the pivot based the smallest value of $\frac{b_i}{A_i4}$ where $i$ is a given row.\\
$min\{
13/2,
5,
\} = 5$\\\ 
Thus, we can deduce the pivot to be in row $A_3$\\\\
Procedure to do the simplex iteration: \\
R3'  = R3/(1/3) \\
R0' = R0 + (-10/3) * R3' \\
R1' = R1 + (2/3) * R3' \\
R2' = R2 + (1/3) * R3' \\
R4' = R4 + (-1/3) * R3' \\

\begin{align}
\begin{bmatrix}
5 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & -10 & 0 & 5\\
3 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 2 & 0 & 5\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 2\\
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 3 & 0 & 5\\
2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 1 & -2\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
